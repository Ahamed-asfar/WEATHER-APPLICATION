🌤️ Weather App using React and OpenWeatherMap API
🔧 Tools & Technologies Used:
React.js – JavaScript library for building user interfaces

OpenWeatherMap API – Free public API for weather data

JavaScript (ES6+) – Core logic and asynchronous handling

Fetch API – For making HTTP requests

CSS3 – For styling and responsive UI

VS Code – Code editor

Node.js & NPM – Project environment and dependency manager

⚠️ *Note*: API key is not included for security reasons.
To run this project locally, create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:

📜 Project Overview:
This project is a real-time Weather Web Application built entirely using React.js and integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display accurate, up-to-date weather information for any city entered by the user. The application allows users to type in a city name, and upon clicking “Get Weather,” the app fetches weather data from the API and displays it in a styled, mobile-friendly interface.

This Weather App was built as part of the full stack MERN internship program to demonstrate practical API integration, clean UI design, and state-driven rendering using React’s component architecture. Every feature and design element was implemented manually without using external UI libraries like Bootstrap or Material UI, ensuring full control over layout and responsiveness.

🔄 Functionality Breakdown:
✅ 1. City Input & Search Handling
The app uses a controlled input field powered by useState to capture the user’s city name. A button triggers an API call to fetch weather data.

✅ 2. Live API Integration
Using the Fetch API, the app makes a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap endpoint using the entered city name and a developer API key. The API call is asynchronous and handled using async/await.

✅ 3. Real-Time Data Rendering
On successful API response, the weather data is displayed, including:

🌡️ Temperature (in Celsius)

💧 Humidity percentage

🌥️ Weather condition description (e.g., "Clear", "Rain", etc.)

🌍 Country and City info

✅ 4. Error Handling
If an invalid city is entered, or if the user submits an empty input, the app displays an error message such as:

“Please enter a city name.”

“City not found.”
This ensures a smooth user experience with guided input validation.

🎨 UI & Design:
The frontend design is fully custom, written in plain CSS (App.css) and styled with gradients, shadow effects, rounded cards, and a clean layout centered in the viewport. The app uses a modern font and color palette to deliver a calm, elegant interface suitable for mobile and desktop. Personalized touches like:

App title: “☁️ Asfar’s Weather App”

Footer: “Made with 🌤️ by Asfar”

…make the app feel personal and internship-ready.

🧠 Learning Outcome:
Through this project, I learned how to:

Build real-time data-driven apps with React hooks

Connect to third-party APIs and handle JSON responses

Manage React component state and conditional rendering

Handle API errors and user input validation

Build and style a frontend UI from scratch

Use async/await with fetch()

🏁 Conclusion:
This Weather App is a complete, polished, and practical React project built from scratch without templates. It reflects my ability to design real-time web applications, work with RESTful APIs, and build modern user interfaces. The project stands as a strong example of my MERN internship training and demonstrates full command over frontend development and asynchronous operations in a React-based environment.
